#### PURPOSE
The purpose of AHunt is to aid scavengar hunts.
Users will gather in one area and will be given an initial “hint” as to where the first part of the scavenger hunt will take place. Each of the notable sites will have strategic QR Codes placed around the area. A hint to the next step of the scavenger hunt will be given if that the user is able to find each location of and scan the previous QR Codes. Users will be put against the clock to find all the items over a specific interval of time. Included in the application is a page where anyone can create and host a scavenger hunt with their own hints and items to be found. The creator of the hunt can specify how much time is given and what prizes, if any, will be given to the competitors who finish before the time is up. How difficult or quick the hunt may be is solely up to the creator. This range of freedom will allow any individual to participate and create any scavenger hunt of their choosing. Essentially, our purpose to get people to discover just how much their environment has to offer.

#### REQUIREMENTS
Essentially, a smartphone with camera capabilities. Preferably, a QR Code scanner application the phone camera does not have that feature.

#### FUNCTIONALITY
The program uses one API: one for a random QR code generator. Allows user to create a scavenger hunts with various QR codes scattered across campus. Each new hunt will have a random code attached to it, and with this code other users will be able to join said hunt on the login page. Those who participate will have their last area visited, given they find the clue at the specific location, tracked. The application will also shows each participant’s progress through the item “Steps”. These “Steps” indicate how close the player is to completing the scavenger hunt. There is also a login/sign-up feature included that can keep up with a user's scavenger hunt information.
